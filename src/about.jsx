        <p className="subtitle">I'm Abrar Shams Chowdhury.<br/><br/>

        I strive to create unique solutions that surprise and delight users while keeping the complex technical dependencies in mind for implementation, scalability and developer sanity.<br/>
        
        An engineer by heart, I love to invent, design, analyze, build, and test.<br/><br/>
        
        
        Jack of all trades because, before finally settling with web development I've worn many different hats. I have tried arts-crafts, graphic design, 2d animation, 3d modeling, wood-working, event management, robotics and product design. 
        Not just scratching the surface, I went pretty deep and made a name for myself in each of those fields.<br/><br/>

        
        I am a designer who loves diving deep into problem solving. So do have a problem to get solved?. Do you want to build a website or web-application that solves a problem?
